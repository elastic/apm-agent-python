This is the official Python module for Elastic APM.

It provides full out-of-the-box support for many of the popular frameworks,
including Django, and Flask. Elastic APM is also easy to adapt for most
WSGI-compatible web applications via `custom integrations`_.

Your application doesn't live on the web? No problem! Elastic APM is easy to use in
any Python application.
