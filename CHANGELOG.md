## v2.0.0

[Check the diff](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/compare/v1.0.0...v2.0.0)

  - moved the library-frame detection from a processor to the stacktrace collection (#113).
  - added settings to enable/disable source code collection and local variables collection for errors and transactions (#117)
  - added `service.environment` to provide an environment name (e.g. "production", "staging") (#123)
  - added `transaction.id` to errors to better correlate errors with transactions (#122)
  - added `transaction_sample_rate` to define a rate with which transactions are sampled (#116)
  - added `error.handled` to indicate if an exception was handled or not (#124).
  - added `transaction_max_spans` setting to limit the amount of spans that are recorded per transaction (#127)
  - added configuration options to limit captured local variables to a certain length (#130)
  - added options for configuring the amount of context lines that are captured with each frame (#136)

  - added option to disable capturing of request body (#151)
  - BREAKING: Several settings and APIs have been renamed (#111, #119, #143):
      - The decorator for custom instrumentation, `elasticapm.trace`, is now `elasticapm.capture_span`
      - The setting `traces_send_frequency` has been renamed to `flush_interval`. The name of the analogous environment variable changed from `ELASTIC_APM_TRACES_SEND_FREQ` to `ELASTIC_APM_FLUSH_INTERVAL`
      - The `app_name` setting has been renamed to `service_name`. The name of the analogous environment variable changed from `ELASTIC_APM_APP_NAME` to `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME`.
      - `app_name` arguments to API calls in the whole code base changed to `service_name`.
      - The `app_version` setting has been renamed to `service_version`. The name of the analogous environment variable changed from `ELASTIC_APM_APP_VERSION` to `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_VERSION`.
      - `context.request.url.raw` has been renamed to `context.request.url.full` (#121)
  - BREAKING: added `elasticapm.set_custom_context` in favor of the more generic `set_custom_data` function (#133)

  - BREAKING: renamed several configuration options to align better with other language agents (#145):
      - `disable_instrumentation` became `instrument` and inverted its meaning
      - `max_event_queue_length` became `max_queue_size`
      - `timeout` became `server_timeout`

## v1.0.0

[Check the diff](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/compare/v1.0.0.dev3...v1.0.0)

  - added `max-event-queue-length` setting. (#67)
  - changed name that the agent reports itself with to the APM server from `elasticapm-python` to `python`. This aligns the Python agent with other languages. (#104)
  - changed Celery integration to store the task state (e.g. `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`) in `transaction.result` (#100)
  - added setting to disable SSL certificate verification (#108)
  - BREAKING: renamed `server` configuration variable to `server_url` to better align with other language agents (#105)
  - BREAKING: removed the old and unused urllib2-based HTTP transport, and renamed the urllib3 transport (#107)
  - BREAKING: several API changes to `capture_exception`, `capture_message`, and added documentation for these and other APIs (#112)

## v1.0.0.dev3

[Check the diff](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/compare/v1.0.0.dev2...v1.0.0.dev2)

  - added a background thread to process the transactions queue every 60 seconds (configurable) (#68)
  - adapted trace context for SQL traces to new API (#77)
  - ensured that transaction data is also passed through processors (#84)
  - added `uninstrument` function to reverse instrumentation, and exposed both `instrument` and `uninstrument` as public API in the `elasticapm` namespace (#90)
  - added normalization of HTTP status codes into classes for the `transaction.result` field. A HTTP status of `200` will be turned into `HTTP 2xx`. The unchanged status code is still available in `context.response.status_code`. (#85)

## v1.0.0.dev2

[Check the diff](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/compare/v1.0.0.dev1...v1.0.0.dev2)

  - added request context information for Flask (#58)
  - added response context information for Flask (#65)
  - BREAKING: changed the `SERVERS` list setting to a single `SERVER` string setting. With this change, we now only support sending events to a single server (#59)
  - BREAKING: removed root trace. Due to historical reason, we used to create a "root trace" which was equivalent to the transaction. This is no longer necessary. #61

## v1.0.0.dev1

[Check the diff](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/compare/v1.0.0.dev0...v1.0.0.dev1)

  - unified configuration across supported frameworks (#33)
