## v4.0.0
[Check the diff](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/compare/v3.0.2...v4.0.0)

**BREAKING** Version 4 of the agent implements a new wire protocol for communicating with
the APM Server. This format is only supported in *APM Server 6.5+*.

Further breaking changes:

 * the undocumented `AsyncioHTTPTransport` has been removed.
 * the `flush_interval` and `max_queue_size` settings have been removed.
 * new settings introduced: `api_request_time` and `api_request_size`.
 * Some settings now require a unit for duration or size. See documentation on
   configuration for more information.
 * The option to provide a custom date for exceptions and messages has been removed.

Other changes:
 * on Python 3.7, use [contextvars](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html) instead of threadlocals for storing
   current transaction and span. This is a necessary precursor for full asyncio support. (#291)

## v3.0.2
[Check the diff](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/compare/v3.0.1...v3.0.2)

 * fixed an issue with detecting names of wrapped functions that are partials (#294)

   HTTP headers are properly sanitized (#275)

      - `disable_instrumentation` became `instrument` and inverted its meaning

## v1.0.0

[Check the diff](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/compare/v1.0.0.dev3...v1.0.0)

  - added `max-event-queue-length` setting. (#67)
  - changed name that the agent reports itself with to the APM server from `elasticapm-python` to `python`. This aligns the Python agent with other languages. (#104)

## v1.0.0.dev2

[Check the diff](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/compare/v1.0.0.dev1...v1.0.0.dev2)
