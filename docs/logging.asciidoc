=== Logging Integrations

`elasticapm` provides integrations with both the default python logging library,
as well as http://www.structlog.org/en/stable/[`structlog`].

[[logging]]
==== `logging`

We provide a https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#filter-objects[filter]
which will add three new attributes to any filtered `LogRecord`:

* `elasticapm_transaction_id`
* `elasticapm_trace_id`
* `ealsticapm_span_id`

Note that because https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#filter-objects[filters
are not propagated to descendent loggers], you should add the filter to each of
your log handlers, as handlers are propagated, along with their attached filters.

[source,python]
----
import logging
from elasticapm.handlers.logging import LoggingFilter

console = logging.StreamHandler()
console.addFilter(LoggingFilter())
# add the handler to the root logger
logging.getLogger("").addHandler(console)
----


[[structlog]]
==== `structlog`

We provide a http://www.structlog.org/en/stable/processors.html[processor] for
http://www.structlog.org/en/stable/[`structlog`] which will add three new keys
to the event_dict of any processed event:

* `"transaction.id"`
* `"trace.id"`
* `"span.id"`

[source,python]
----
from structlog import PrintLogger, wrap_logger
from elasticapm.handlers.structlog import structlog_processor

wrapped_logger = PrintLogger()
logger = wrap_logger(wrapped_logger, processors=[structlog_processor])
log = logger.new()
log.msg("some_event")
