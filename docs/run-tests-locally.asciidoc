=== Run Tests Locally

To run tests locally you can make use of the docker images also used when running the whole test suite with Jenkins.
Running the full test suite first does some linting and then runs the actual tests with different versions of Python and different web frameworks.
For a full overview of the test matrix and supported versions have a look at
https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/blob/master/Jenkinsfile[Jenkins Configuration].

[[pre-commit]]
==== Pre Commit
We run our git hooks on every commit to automatically point out issues in code. Those issues are also detected within the Jenkins pipeline.
Please follow the installation steps stated in https://pre-commit.com/#install.

[[coder-linter]]
==== Code Linter
We run two code linters `isort` and `flake8`. You can trigger each single one locally by running:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./tests/scripts/docker/isort.sh <pip-cache-dir>
----

[source,bash]
----
$ ./tests/scripts/docker/flake8.sh <pip-cache-dir>
----

[[coder-formatter]]
==== Code Formatter
We test that the code is formatted using `black`. You can trigger this check by running:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./tests/scripts/docker/black.sh <pip-cache-dir>
----

[float]
[[test-documentation]]
==== Test Documentation
We test that the documentation can be generated without errors. You can trigger this check by running:
[source,bash]
----
$ ./tests/scripts/docker/docs.sh
----

[float]
[[running-tests]]
==== Running Tests
We run the test suite on different combinations of Python versions and web frameworks. For triggering the test suite for a specific combination locally you can run:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./tests/scripts/docker/run_tests.sh python-version framework-version <pip-cache-dir>
----
NOTE: The `python-version` must be of format `python:version`, e.g. `python:3.6` or `pypy:2`.
The `framework` must be of format `framework-version`, e.g. `django-1.10` or `flask-0.12`.
