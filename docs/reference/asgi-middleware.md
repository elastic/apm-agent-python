# ASGI Middleware [asgi-middleware]

::::{warning}
This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
::::


Incorporating Elastic APM into your ASGI-based project only requires a few easy steps.

::::{note}
Several ASGI frameworks are supported natively. Please check [Supported Technologies](/reference/supported-technologies.md) for more information
::::



## Installation [asgi-installation]

Install the Elastic APM agent using pip:

```bash
$ pip install elastic-apm
```

or add `elastic-apm` to your project’s `requirements.txt` file.


## Setup [asgi-setup]

To set up the agent, you need to initialize it with appropriate settings.

The settings are configured either via environment variables, or as initialization arguments.

You can find a list of all available settings in the [Configuration](/reference/configuration.md) page.

To set up the APM agent, wrap your ASGI app with the `ASGITracingMiddleware`:

```python
from elasticapm.contrib.asgi import ASGITracingMiddleware

app = MyGenericASGIApp()  # depending on framework

app = ASGITracingMiddleware(app)
```

Make sure to call [`elasticapm.set_transaction_name()`](/reference/api-reference.md#api-set-transaction-name) with an appropriate transaction name in all your routes.

::::{note}
Currently, the agent doesn’t support automatic capturing of exceptions. You can follow progress on this issue on [Github](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/issues/1548).

## Supported Python versions [supported-python-versions]

A list of supported [Python](/reference/supported-technologies.md#supported-python) versions can be found on our [Supported Technologies](/reference/supported-technologies.md) page.

::::{note}
Elastic APM only supports `asyncio` when using Python 3.7+
