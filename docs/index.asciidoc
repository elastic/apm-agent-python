== Getting started

Welcome to the APM Python agent docs.

NOTE: The documentation pages are still work in progress. For more details also check the APM Python Agent https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python[GitHub repository].

The Elastic APM Python agent sends performance metrics and error logs to the APM Server.
It has built-in support for Django and Flask performance metrics and error logging, as well as generic support of other WSGI frameworks for error logging.
