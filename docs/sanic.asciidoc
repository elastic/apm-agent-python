=== Sanic Support

Incorporating Elastic APM into your Sanic project only requires a few easy
steps.

[float]
[[sanic-installation]]
==== Installation

Install the Elastic APM agent using pip:

[source,bash]
----
$ pip install elastic-apm
----

or add `elastic-apm` to your project's `requirements.txt` file.


[float]
[[sanic-setup]]
==== Setup

To set up the agent, you need to initialize it with appropriate settings.

The settings are configured either via environment variables, or as
initialization arguments.

You can find a list of all available settings in the
<<configuration, Configuration>> page.

To initialize the agent for your application using environment variables:

[source,python]
----
from sanic import Sanic
from elasticapm.contrib.sanic import ElasticAPM

app = Sanic(name="elastic-apm-sample")
apm = ElasticAPM(app=app)
----

To configure the agent using initialization arguments and Sanic's Configuration infrastructure:

[source,python]
----
# Create a file named external_config.py in your application
# If you want this module based configuration to be used for APM, prefix them with ELASTIC_APM_
ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL = "https://serverurl.apm.com:443"
ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN = "sometoken"
----

[source,python]
----
from sanic import Sanic
from elasticapm.contrib.sanic import ElasticAPM

app = Sanic(name="elastic-apm-sample")
app.config.update_config("path/to/external_config.py")
apm = ElasticAPM(app=app)
----

[float]
[[sanic-usage]]
==== Usage

Once you have configured the agent, it will automatically track transactions
and capture uncaught exceptions within sanic.

Capture an arbitrary exception by calling
<<client-api-capture-exception,`capture_exception`>>:

[source,python]
----
from sanic import Sanic
from elasticapm.contrib.sanic import ElasticAPM

app = Sanic(name="elastic-apm-sample")
apm = ElasticAPM(app=app)

try:
    1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    apm.capture_exception()
----

Log a generic message with <<client-api-capture-message,`capture_message`>>:

[source,python]
----
from sanic import Sanic
from elasticapm.contrib.sanic import ElasticAPM

app = Sanic(name="elastic-apm-sample")
apm = ElasticAPM(app=app)

apm.capture_message('hello, world!')
----

[float]
[[sanic-performance-metrics]]
==== Performance metrics

If you've followed the instructions above, the agent has installed our
instrumentation middleware which will process all requests through your app.
This will measure response times, as well as detailed performance data for
all supported technologies.

NOTE: Due to the fact that `asyncio` drivers are usually separate from their
synchronous counterparts, specific instrumentation is needed for all drivers.
The support for asynchronous drivers is currently quite limited.

[float]
[[sanic-ignoring-specific-views]]
===== Ignoring specific routes

You can use the
<<config-transactions-ignore-patterns,`TRANSACTIONS_IGNORE_PATTERNS`>>
configuration option to ignore specific routes. The list given should be a
list of regular expressions which are matched against the transaction name:

[source,python]
----
from sanic import Sanic
from elasticapm.contrib.sanic import ElasticAPM

app = Sanic(name="elastic-apm-sample")
apm = ElasticAPM(app=app, config={
    'TRANSACTIONS_IGNORE_PATTERNS': ['^GET /secret', '/extra_secret'],
})
----

This would ignore any requests using the `GET /secret` route
and any requests containing `/extra_secret`.


[float]
[[supported-starlette-and-python-versions]]
==== Supported Starlette and Python versions

A list of supported <<supported-sanic,Sanic>> and
<<supported-python,Python>> versions can be found on our
<<supported-technologies,Supported Technologies>> page.

NOTE: Elastic APM only supports `asyncio` when using Python 3.7+
