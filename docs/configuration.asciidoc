[[configuration]]
== Configuration

To adapt the Elastic APM agent to your needs, you can configure it using environment variables, or framework specific
configuration.

You can either configure the agent by setting environment variables:
[source,bash]
----
ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME=foo python manage.py runserver
----

or with inline configuration: 

[source,python]
----
apm_client = Client(service_name="foo")
----

or by using framework specific configuration e.g. in your Django `settings.py` file:

[source,python]
----
ELASTIC_APM = {
    "SERVICE_NAME": "foo",
}
----

The precedence is as follows:

 * <<config-central_config, central configuration>>
 * environment variables
 * inline configuration
 * framework specific configuration
 * default value

[float]
[[django-configuration]]
=== Django

To configure Django, add an `ELASTIC_APM` dictionary to your `settings.py`:

[source,python]
----
ELASTIC_APM = {
    'SERVICE_NAME': 'my-app',
    'SECRET_TOKEN': 'changeme',
}
----

[float]
[[flask-configuration]]
=== Flask

To configure Flask, add an `ELASTIC_APM` dictionary to your `app.config`:

[source,python]
----
app.config['ELASTIC_APM'] = {
    'SERVICE_NAME': 'my-app',
    'SECRET_TOKEN': 'changeme',
}

apm = ElasticAPM(app)
----

[[required-options]]
=== Required options

[float]
[[config-service-name]]
==== `service_name`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                | Django/Flask      | Default    | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME` | `SERVICE_NAME`    | `None`     | `my-app`
|============


The name of your service.
This is used to keep all the errors and transactions of your service together
and is the primary filter in the Elastic APM user interface.

NOTE: The service name must conform to this regular expression: `^[a-zA-Z0-9 _-]+$`.
In less regexy terms:
Your service name must only contain characters from the ASCII alphabet, numbers, dashes, underscores and spaces.

[float]
[[config-server-url]]
==== `server_url`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment              | Django/Flask   | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL` | `SERVER_URL`   | `'http://localhost:8200'`
|============

The URL for your APM Server.
The URL must be fully qualified, including protocol (`http` or `https`) and port.


[float]
[[config-transport-class]]
==== `transport_class`

|============
| Environment                   | Django/Flask      | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSPORT_CLASS` | `TRANSPORT_CLASS` | `elasticapm.transport.http.AsyncTransport`
|============


The transport class to use when sending events to the APM Server.
The default `AsyncTransport` uses a background thread to send data.
If your environment doesn't allow background threads, you can use
`elasticapm.transport.http.Transport` instead.
Note however that this can have adverse effects on performance.


[float]
[[other-options]]
=== Other options

[float]
[[config-environment]]
==== `environment`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment               | Django/Flask   | Default    | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_ENVIRONMENT` | `ENVIRONMENT`  | `None`     | `"production"`
|============

The name of the environment this service is deployed in,
e.g. "production" or "staging".

Environments allow you to easily filter data on a global level in the APM app.
It's important to be consistent when naming environments across agents.
See {kibana-ref}/filters.html#environment-selector[environment selector] in the APM app for more information.

NOTE: This feature is fully supported in the APM app in Kibana versions >= 7.2.
You must use the query bar to filter for a specific environment in versions prior to 7.2.

[float]
[[config-secret-token]]
==== `secret_token`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                | Django/Flask    | Default    | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN` | `SECRET_TOKEN`  | `None`     | A random string
|============

This string is used to ensure that only your agents can send data to your APM Server.
Both the agents and the APM Server have to be configured with the same secret token.
One example to generate a secure secret token is:

[source,bash]
----
python -c "import uuid; print(str(uuid.uuid4()))"
----

WARNING: secret tokens only provide any security if your APM Server use TLS.

[float]
[[config-service-version]]
==== `service_version`
[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                    | Django/Flask        | Default    | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_VERSION`  | `SERVICE_VERSION`   | `None`     | A string indicating the version of the deployed service
|============

A version string for the currently deployed version of the service.
If you don't version your deployments,
the recommended value for this field is the commit identifier of the deployed revision, e.g. the output of `git rev-parse HEAD`.

[float]
[[config-framework-name]]

For Django and Flask, this defaults to `django` and `flask` respectively,
otherwise, the default is `None`.


[float]
[[config-framework-version]]
==== `framework_version`
[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                     | Django/Flask        | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_FRAMEWORK_VERSION` | `FRAMEWORK_VERSION` | Depending on framework
|============

Version number of the used framework.
For Django and Flask, this defaults to the used version of the framework,
otherwise, the default is `None`.

[float]
[[config-filter-exception-types]]
==== `filter_exception_types`
[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                          | Django/Flask                  | Default  | Example

| multiple values separated by commas, without spaces |||
|============

A list of exception types to be filtered.
Exceptions of these types will not be sent to the APM Server.


[float]
[[config-transactions-ignore-patterns]]
==== `transactions_ignore_patterns`
[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                                | Django/Flask                    | Default  | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTIONS_IGNORE_PATTERNS` | `TRANSACTIONS_IGNORE_PATTERNS`  | `[]`     | `['^OPTIONS ', 'myviews.Healthcheck']`
| multiple values separated by commas, without spaces |||
|============

A list of regular expressions.
Transactions that match any of the of the configured patterns will be ignored and not sent to the APM Server.


[float]
[[config-server-timeout]]
==== `server_timeout`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                  | Django/Flask         | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_TIMEOUT` | `SERVER_TIMEOUT`     | `"5s"`
|============

A timeout for requests to the APM Server.
The setting has to be provided in *<<config-format-duration, duration format>>*.
If a request to the APM Server takes longer than the configured timeout,
the request is cancelled and the event (exception or transaction) is discarded.
Set to `None` to disable timeouts.

WARNING: If timeouts are disabled or set to a high value,
your app could experience memory issues if the APM Server times out.


[float]
[[config-hostname]]
==== `hostname`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                | Django/Flask  | Default                | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_HOSTNAME`     | `HOSTNAME`    | `socket.gethostname()` | `app-server01.example.com`
|============

The host name to use when sending error and transaction data to the APM Server.

[float]
[[config-auto-log-stacks]]
==== `auto_log_stacks`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                   | Django/Flask      | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_AUTO_LOG_STACKS` | `AUTO_LOG_STACKS` | `True`
| set to `"true"` / `"false"` |||
|============

If set to `True` (the default), the agent will add a stack trace to each log event,
indicating where the log message has been issued.

This setting can be overridden on an individual basis by setting the `extra`-key `stack`:

[source,python]
----
logger.info('something happened', extra={'stack': False})
----

[float]
[[config-collect-local-variables]]
==== `collect_local_variables`

|============
| Environment                           | Django/Flask              | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_COLLECT_LOCAL_VARIABLES` | `COLLECT_LOCAL_VARIABLES` | `errors`
|============

Possible values: `errors`, `transactions`, `all`, `off`

The Elastic APM Python agent can collect local variables for stack frames.
By default, this is only done for errors.

NOTE: collecting local variables has a non-trivial overhead.
Collecting local variables for transactions in production environments
can have adverse effects for the performance of your service.

[float]
[[config-local-var-max-length]]
==== `local_var_max_length`

|============
| Environment                        | Django/Flask           | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_LOCAL_VAR_MAX_LENGTH` | `LOCAL_VAR_MAX_LENGTH` | `200`
|============

When collecting local variables, they will be converted to strings.
With this setting, you can limit the length of resulting string.


[float]
[[config-local-list-var-max-length]]
==== `local_var_list_max_length`

|============
| Environment                             | Django/Flask                | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_LOCAL_VAR_LIST_MAX_LENGTH` | `LOCAL_VAR_LIST_MAX_LENGTH` | `10`
|============

With this setting, you can limit the length of lists in local variables.


[float]
[[config-source-lines-error-app-frames]]
==== `source_lines_error_app_frames`
[float]
[[config-source-lines-error-library-frames]]
==== `source_lines_error_library_frames`
[float]
[[config-source-lines-span-app-frames]]
==== `source_lines_span_app_frames`
[float]
[[config-source-lines-span-library-frames]]
==== `source_lines_span_library_frames`

|============
| Environment                                     | Django/Flask                        | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_SOURCE_LINES_ERROR_APP_FRAMES`     | `SOURCE_LINES_ERROR_APP_FRAMES`     | `5`
| `ELASTIC_APM_SOURCE_LINES_ERROR_LIBRARY_FRAMES` | `SOURCE_LINES_ERROR_LIBRARY_FRAMES` | `5`
| `ELASTIC_APM_SOURCE_LINES_SPAN_APP_FRAMES`      | `SOURCE_LINES_SPAN_APP_FRAMES`      | `0`
| `ELASTIC_APM_SOURCE_LINES_SPAN_LIBRARY_FRAMES`  | `SOURCE_LINES_SPAN_LIBRARY_FRAMES`  | `0`
|============

By default, the APM agent collects source code snippets for errors.
With the above settings, you can modify how many lines of source code is collected.

We differ between errors and spans, as well as library frames and app frames.

WARNING: Especially for spans, collecting source code can have a large impact on storage use in your Elasticsearch cluster.

[float]
[[config-capture-body]]
==== `capture_body`

|============
| Environment                | Django/Flask   | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_CAPTURE_BODY` | `CAPTURE_BODY` | `off`
|============

For transactions that are HTTP requests,
the Python agent can optionally capture the request body (e.g. `POST` variables).

Possible values: `errors`, `transactions`, `all`, `off`.

If the request has a body and this setting is disabled, the body will be shown as `[REDACTED]`.

For requests with a content type of `multipart/form-data`,
any uploaded files will be referenced in a special `_files` key.
It contains the name of the field, and the name of the uploaded file, if provided.

WARNING: request bodies often contain sensitive values like passwords, credit card numbers etc.
If your service handles data like this, we advise to only enable this feature with care.

[float]
[[config-capture-headers]]
==== `capture_headers`

|============
| Environment                   | Django/Flask      | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_CAPTURE_HEADERS` | `CAPTURE_HEADERS` | `true`
|============

For transactions and errors that happen due to HTTP requests,
the Python agent can optionally capture the request and response headers.

Possible values: `true`, `false`

WARNING: request headers often contain sensitive values like session IDs, cookies etc.
See our documentation on <<sanitizing-data, sanitizing data>> for more information on how to
filter such data.

[float]
[[config-transaction-max-spans]]
==== `transaction_max_spans`

|============
| Environment                         | Django/Flask            | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_MAX_SPANS` | `TRANSACTION_MAX_SPANS` | `500`
|============

Limits the amount of spans that are recorded per transaction.
This is helpful in cases where a transaction creates a very high amount of spans (e.g. thousands of SQL queries).
Setting an upper limit will prevent overloading the agent and the APM Server with too much work for such edge cases.

[float]
[[config-span-frames-min-duration]]
==== `span_frames_min_duration`

|============
| Environment                            | Django/Flask               | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_SPAN_FRAMES_MIN_DURATION` | `SPAN_FRAMES_MIN_DURATION` | `"5ms"`
|============

In its default settings, the APM agent will collect a stack trace with every recorded span.
While this is very helpful to find the exact place in your code that causes the span,
collecting this stack trace does have some overhead.

To collect traces for all spans, independent of the length, set the value to `-1`.
Setting it to a positive value, e.g. `5`, will limit stack trace collection to spans
with durations equal or longer than the given value in milliseconds, e.g. 5 milliseconds.

To disable stack trace collection for spans completely, set the value to `0`.

Except for the special values `-1` and `0`,
this setting has to be provided in *<<config-format-duration, duration format>>*.

[float]
[[config-api-request-size]]
==== `api_request_size`

|============
| Environment                    | Django/Flask       | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_API_REQUEST_SIZE` | `API_REQUEST_SIZE` | `"724kb"`
|============

Maximum queue length of the request buffer before sending the request to the APM Server.
A lower value will increase the load on your APM Server,
while a higher value can increase the memory pressure of your app.
A higher value also impacts the time until data is indexed and searchable in Elasticsearch.

This setting is useful to limit memory consumption if you experience a sudden spike of traffic.
It has to be provided in *<<config-format-size, size format>>*.

NOTE: Due to internal buffering of gzip, the actual request size can be a few kilobytes larger than the given limit.
By default, the APM Server limits request payload size to 1 MByte.

[float]
[[config-api-request-time]]
==== `api_request_time`

|============
| Environment                    | Django/Flask       | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_API_REQUEST_TIME` | `API_REQUEST_TIME` | `"10s"`
|============

Maximum queue time of the request buffer before sending the request to the APM Server.
A lower value will increase the load on your APM Server,
while a higher value can increase the memory pressure of your app.
A higher value also impacts the time until data is indexed and searchable in Elasticsearch.

This setting is useful to limit memory consumption if you experience a sudden spike of traffic.
It has to be provided in *<<config-format-duration, duration format>>*.

NOTE: The actual time will vary between 90-110% of the given value,
to avoid stampedes of instances that start at the same time.

[float]
[[config-processors]]
==== `processors`

|============
| Environment              | Django/Flask | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_PROCESSORS` | `PROCESSORS` | `['elasticapm.processors.sanitize_stacktrace_locals',
                                              'elasticapm.processors.sanitize_http_request_cookies',
                                              'elasticapm.processors.sanitize_http_headers',
                                              'elasticapm.processors.sanitize_http_wsgi_env',
                                              'elasticapm.processors.sanitize_http_request_querystring',
                                              'elasticapm.processors.sanitize_http_request_body']`
|============

A list of processors to process transactions and errors.
For more information, see <<sanitizing-data, Sanitizing Data>>.

WARNING: We recommend to always include the default set of validators if you customize this setting.


[float]
[[config-transaction-sample-rate]]
==== `transaction_sample_rate`

|============
| Environment                           | Django/Flask              | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_SAMPLE_RATE` | `TRANSACTION_SAMPLE_RATE` | `1.0`
|============

By default, the agent will sample every transaction (e.g. request to your service).
To reduce overhead and storage requirements, you can set the sample rate to a value between `0.0` and `1.0`.
We still record overall time and the result for unsampled transactions, but no context information, labels, or spans.

[float]
[[config-include-paths]]
==== `include_paths`

|============
| Environment                 | Django/Flask    | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_INCLUDE_PATHS` | `INCLUDE_PATHS` | `[]`
| multiple values separated by commas, without spaces |||
|============

A set of paths, optionally using shell globs
(see https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html[`fnmatch`] for a description of the syntax).
These are matched against the absolute filename of every frame, and if a pattern matches, the frame is considered
to be an "in-app frame".

`include_paths` *takes precedence* over `exclude_paths`.

[float]
[[config-exclude-paths]]
==== `exclude_paths`

|============
| Environment                 | Django/Flask    | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_EXCLUDE_PATHS` | `EXCLUDE_PATHS` | Varies on Python version and implementation
| multiple values separated by commas, without spaces |||
|============

A set of paths, optionally using shell globs
(see https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html[`fnmatch`] for a description of the syntax).
These are matched against the absolute filename of every frame, and if a pattern matches, the frame is considered
to be a "library frame".

`include_paths` *takes precedence* over `exclude_paths`.

The default value varies based on your Python version and implementation, e.g.:

 * PyPy3: `['\*/lib-python/3/*', '\*/site-packages/*']`
 * CPython 2.7: `['\*/lib/python2.7/*', '\*/lib64/python2.7/*']`

[float]
[[config-debug]]
==== `debug`
|============
| Environment         | Django/Flask  | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_DEBUG` | `DEBUG`       | `False`
|============

If your app is in debug mode (e.g. in Django with `settings.DEBUG = True` or in Flask with `app.debug = True`),
the agent won't send any data to the APM Server. You can override it by changing this setting to `True`.


[float]
[[config-disable-send]]
==== `disable_send`
|============
| Environment                 | Django/Flask   | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_DISABLE_SEND`  | `DISABLE_SEND` | `False`
|============

If set to `True`, the agent won't send any events to the APM Server, independent of any debug state.


[float]
[[config-instrument]]
==== `instrument`
|============
| Environment               | Django/Flask | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_INSTRUMENT`  | `INSTRUMENT` | `True`
|============

If set to `False`, the agent won't instrument any code.
This disables most of the tracing functionality, but can be useful to debug possible instrumentation issues.


[float]
[[config-verify-server-cert]]
==== `verify_server_cert`
|============
| Environment                       | Django/Flask         | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT`  | `VERIFY_SERVER_CERT` | `True`
|============

By default, the agent verifies the SSL certificate if you use an HTTPS connection to the APM Server.
Verification can be disabled by changing this setting to `False`.
This setting is ignored when <<config-server-cert,`server_cert`>> is set.

NOTE: SSL certificate verification is only available in Python 2.7.9+ and Python 3.4.3+.

[float]
[[config-server-cert]]
==== `server_cert`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                | Django/Flask  | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_CERT`  | `SERVER_CERT` | `None`
|============

If you have configured your APM Server with a self signed TLS certificate, or you
just wish to pin the server certificate, you can specify the path to the PEM-encoded
certificate via the `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_CERT` configuration.

[float]
[[config-metrics_interval]]
==== `metrics_interval`
|============
| Environment                     | Django/Flask       | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_METRICS_INTERVAL`  | `METRICS_INTERVAL` | `30s`
|============


The interval in which the agent collects metrics. A shorter interval increases the granularity of metrics,
but also increases the overhead of the agent, as well as storage requirements.

It has to be provided in *<<config-format-duration, duration format>>*.

[float]
[[config-disable_metrics]]
==== `disable_metrics`
|============
| Environment                     | Django/Flask      | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_DISABLE_METRICS`   | `DISABLE_METRICS` | `None`
|============


A comma-separated list of dotted metrics names that should not be sent to the APM Server.
You can use `*` to match multiple metrics. As an example, to disable all CPU-related metrics,
as well as the "total system memory" metric, you would set `disable_metrics` to:

....
"*.cpu.*,system.memory.total"
....

NOTE: this setting only disables the *sending* of the given metrics, not collection.

[float]
[[config-breakdown_metrics]]
==== `breakdown_metrics`
|============
| Environment                       | Django/Flask        | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_BREAKDOWN_METRICS`   | `BREAKDOWN_METRICS` | `True`
|============

Enable/disable the tracking and collection of breakdown metrics.
By setting this to `False`, tracking this metric is completely disabled, which can reduce the overhead of the agent. 

NOTE: This feature requires APM Server and Kibana >= 7.3.

[float]
[[config-central_config]]
==== `central_config`
|============
| Environment                       | Django/Flask        | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_CENTRAL_CONFIG`      | `CENTRAL_CONFIG`    | `True`
|============

When enabled, the agent will make periodic requests to the APM Server to fetch updated configuration.

See {kibana-ref}/agent-configuration.html#agent-configuration[APM Agent Configuration] for more documentation on central agent configuration.

NOTE: This feature requires APM Server and Kibana >= 7.3.

[float]
[[config-global_labels]]
==== `global_labels`
|============
| Environment                       | Django/Flask        | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_GLOBAL_LABELS`       | `GLOBAL_LABELS`     | `None`
|============

Labels added to all events, with the format `key=value[,key=value[,...]]`.
Any labels set by application via the API will override global labels with the same keys.

NOTE: This feature requires APM Server >= 7.2.

[float]
[[config-generic-disable-log-record-factory]]
==== `disable_log_record_factory`
|============
| Environment                              | Django/Flask                 | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_DISABLE_LOG_RECORD_FACTORY` | `DISABLE_LOG_RECORD_FACTORY` | `False`
|============

By default in python 3, the agent will install a <<logging,LogRecord factory>> that
automatically adds tracing fields to your log records. You can disable this
behavior by setting this to `True`.

[float]
[[config-django-specific]]
=== Django-specific configuration

[float]
[[config-django-transaction-name-from-route]]
==== `django_transaction_name_from_route`
|============
| Environment                                       | Django                               | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_DJANGO_TRANSACTION_NAME_FROM_ROUTE`  | `DJANGO_TRANSACTION_NAME_FROM_ROUTE` | `False`
|============


By default, we use the function or class name of the view as the transaction name.
Starting with Django 2.2, Django makes the route (e.g. `users/<int:user_id>/`) available on the `request.resolver_match` object.
If you want to use the route instead of the view name as the transaction name, you can set this config option to `true`.

NOTE: in versions previous to Django 2.2, changing this setting will have no effect.

[float]
[[config-generic-environment]]
=== Generic Environment variables

Some environment variables that are not specific to the APM agent can be used to configure the agent.

[float]
[[config-generic-http-proxy]]
==== `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`

Using `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`, the agent can be instructed to use a proxy to connect to the APM Server.
If both are set, `HTTPS_PROXY` takes precedence.

NOTE: The environment variables are case-insensitive.

[float]
[[config-generic-no-proxy]]
==== `NO_PROXY`

To instruct the agent to *not* use a proxy, you can use the `NO_PROXY` environment variable.
You can either set it to a comma-separated list of hosts for which no proxy should be used (e.g. `localhost,example.com`)
or use `*` to match any host.

This is useful if `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` is set for other reasons than agent / APM Server communication.


[float]
[[config-formats]]
=== Configuration formats

Some options require a unit, either duration or size.
These need to be provided in a specific format.

[float]
[[config-format-duration]]
==== Duration format

The _duration_ format is used for options like timeouts.
The unit is provided as suffix directly after the number, without and separation by whitespace.

*Example*: `5ms`

*Supported units* 

 * `ms` (milliseconds)
 * `s` (seconds)
 * `m` (minutes)
 
[float]
[[config-format-size]]
==== Size format

The _size_ format is used for options like maximum buffer sizes.
The unit is provided as suffix directly after the number, without and separation by whitespace.


*Example*: `10kb`

*Supported units*:

 * `b` (bytes)
 * `kb` (kilobytes)
 * `mb` (megabytes)
 * `gb` (gigabytes)

NOTE: we use the power-of-two sizing convention, e.g. `1 kilobyte == 1024 bytes`
