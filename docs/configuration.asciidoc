[[configuration]]
== Configuration

To adapt the Elastic APM agent to your needs, configure it using environment variables or framework-specific
configuration.

You can either configure the agent by setting environment variables:
[source,bash]
----
ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME=foo python manage.py runserver
----

or with inline configuration:

[source,python]
----
apm_client = Client(service_name="foo")
----

or by using framework specific configuration e.g. in your Django `settings.py` file:

[source,python]
----
ELASTIC_APM = {
    "SERVICE_NAME": "foo",
}
----

The precedence is as follows:

 * <<config-central_config,Central configuration>>
(supported options are marked with <<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >>)
 * Environment variables
 * Inline configuration
 * Framework-specific configuration
 * Default value

[float]
[[dynamic-configuration]]
=== Dynamic configuration

Configuration options marked with the image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] badge can be changed at runtime
when set from a supported source.

The Python Agent supports {apm-app-ref}/agent-configuration.html[Central configuration],
which allows you to fine-tune certain configurations from in the APM app.
This feature is enabled in the Agent by default with <<config-central_config>>.

[float]
[[django-configuration]]
=== Django

To configure Django, add an `ELASTIC_APM` dictionary to your `settings.py`:

[source,python]
----
ELASTIC_APM = {
    'SERVICE_NAME': 'my-app',
    'SECRET_TOKEN': 'changeme',
}
----

[float]
[[flask-configuration]]
=== Flask

To configure Flask, add an `ELASTIC_APM` dictionary to your `app.config`:

[source,python]
----
app.config['ELASTIC_APM'] = {
    'SERVICE_NAME': 'my-app',
    'SECRET_TOKEN': 'changeme',
}

apm = ElasticAPM(app)
----

[float]
[[core-options]]
=== Core options

[float]
[[config-service-name]]
==== `service_name`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                | Django/Flask      | Default                   | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME` | `SERVICE_NAME`    | `unknown-python-service`  | `my-app`
|============


The name of your service.
This is used to keep all the errors and transactions of your service together
and is the primary filter in the Elastic APM user interface.

While a default is provided, it is essential that you override this default
with something more descriptive and unique across your infrastructure.

NOTE: The service name must conform to this regular expression: `^[a-zA-Z0-9 _-]+$`.
In other words, the service name must only contain characters from the ASCII alphabet, numbers, dashes, underscores, and spaces.

[float]
[[config-server-url]]
==== `server_url`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment              | Django/Flask   | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL` | `SERVER_URL`   | `'http://localhost:8200'`
|============

The URL for your APM Server.
The URL must be fully qualified, including protocol (`http` or `https`) and port.

[float]
[[config-enabled]]
=== `enabled`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment           | Django/Flask | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_ENABLED` | `ENABLED`    | `true`
|============

Enable or disable the agent.
When set to false, the agent will not collect any data or start any background threads.


[float]
[[config-recording]]
=== `recording`

<<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >>

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment             | Django/Flask   | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_RECORDING` | `RECORDING`    | `true`
|============

Enable or disable recording of events.
If set to false, then the Python agent does not send any events to the Elastic APM server,
and instrumentation overhead is minimized. The agent will continue to poll the server for configuration changes.


[float]
[[logging-options]]
=== Logging Options

[float]
[[config-log_level]]
==== `log_level`

<<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >>

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment             | Django/Flask | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_LOG_LEVEL` | `LOG_LEVEL`  |
|============

The `logging.logLevel` at which the `elasticapm` logger will log. The available
options are:

* `"off"` (sets `logging.logLevel` to 1000)
* `"critical"`
* `"error"`
* `"warning"`
* `"info"`
* `"debug"`
* `"trace"` (sets `logging.log_level` to 5)

Options are case-insensitive

Note that this option doesn't do anything with logging handlers. In order
for any logs to be visible, you must either configure a handler
(https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.basicConfig[`logging.basicConfig`]
will do this for you) or set <<config-log_file>>. This will also override
any log level your app has set for the `elasticapm` logger.

[float]
[[config-log_file]]
==== `log_file`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment             | Django/Flask | Default | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_LOG_FILE` | `LOG_FILE`    | `""`    | `"/var/log/elasticapm/log.txt"`
|============

This enables the agent to log to a file. This is disabled by default. The agent will log
at the `logging.logLevel` configured with <<config-log_level>>. Use
<<config-log_file_size>> to configure the maximum size of the log file. This log
file will automatically rotate.

Note that setting <<config-log_level>> is required for this setting to do
anything.

If https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging-python[`ecs_logging`] is installed,
the logs will automatically be formatted as ecs-compatible json.

[float]
[[config-log_file_size]]
==== `log_file_size`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                 | Django/Flask    | Default     | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_LOG_FILE_SIZE` | `LOG_FILE_SIZE` | `"50mb"`    | `"100mb"`
|============

The size of the log file if <<config-log_file>> is set.

The agent always keeps one backup file when rotating, so the maximum space that
the log files will consume is twice the value of this setting.

[float]
[[config-log_ecs_reformatting]]
==== `log_ecs_reformatting`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                        | Django/Flask           | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_LOG_ECS_REFORMATTING` | `LOG_ECS_REFORMATTING` | `"off"`
|============

experimental::[]

Valid options:

* `"off"`
* `"override"`

If https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging-python[`ecs_logging`] is installed,
setting this to `"override"` will cause the agent to automatically attempt to enable
ecs-formatted logging.

For base `logging` from the standard library, the agent will get the root
logger, find any attached handlers, and for each, set the formatter to
`ecs_logging.StdlibFormatter()`.

If `structlog` is installed, the agent will override any configured processors
with `ecs_logging.StructlogFormatter()`.

Note that this is a very blunt instrument that could have unintended side effects.
If problems arise, please apply these formatters manually and leave this setting
as `"off"`. See the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs-logging/python/current/installation.html[`ecs_logging` docs]
for more information about using these formatters.

Also note that this setting does not facilitate shipping logs to Elasticsearch.
We recommend https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat[Filebeat] for that purpose.

[float]
[[other-options]]
=== Other options

[float]
[[config-transport-class]]
==== `transport_class`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                   | Django/Flask      | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSPORT_CLASS` | `TRANSPORT_CLASS` | `elasticapm.transport.http.Transport`
|============


The transport class to use when sending events to the APM Server.

[float]
[[config-service-node-name]]
==== `service_node_name`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                     | Django/Flask         | Default    | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NODE_NAME` | `SERVICE_NODE_NAME`  | `None`     | `"redis1"`
|============

The name of the given service node. This is optional and if omitted, the APM
Server will fall back on `system.container.id` if available, and
`host.name` if necessary.

This option allows you to set the node name manually to ensure it is unique and meaningful.

[float]
[[config-environment]]
==== `environment`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment               | Django/Flask   | Default    | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_ENVIRONMENT` | `ENVIRONMENT`  | `None`     | `"production"`
|============

The name of the environment this service is deployed in,
e.g. "production" or "staging".

Environments allow you to easily filter data on a global level in the APM app.
It's important to be consistent when naming environments across agents.
See {apm-app-ref}/filters.html#environment-selector[environment selector] in the APM app for more information.

NOTE: This feature is fully supported in the APM app in Kibana versions >= 7.2.
You must use the query bar to filter for a specific environment in versions prior to 7.2.

[float]
[[config-cloud-provider]]
==== `cloud_provider`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                  | Django/Flask      | Default    | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_CLOUD_PROVIDER` | `CLOUD_PROVIDER`  | `"auto"`     | `"aws"`
|============

This config value allows you to specify which cloud provider should be assumed
for metadata collection. By default, the agent will attempt to detect the cloud
provider or, if that fails, will use trial and error to collect the metadata.

Valid options are `"auto"`, `"aws"`, `"gcp"`, and `"azure"`. If this config value is set
to `"none"`, then no cloud metadata will be collected.

[float]
[[config-secret-token]]
==== `secret_token`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                | Django/Flask    | Default    | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN` | `SECRET_TOKEN`  | `None`     | A random string
|============

This string is used to ensure that only your agents can send data to your APM Server.
Both the agents and the APM Server have to be configured with the same secret token.
An example to generate a secure secret token is:

[source,bash]
----
python -c "import uuid; print(str(uuid.uuid4()))"
----

WARNING: Secret tokens only provide any security if your APM Server uses TLS.

[float]
[[config-api-key]]
==== `api_key`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment           | Django/Flask | Default | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_API_KEY` | `API_KEY`    | `None`   | A base64-encoded string
|============

experimental::[]

// TODO: add link to APM Server API Key docs once the docs are released

This base64-encoded string is used to ensure that only your agents can send data to your APM Server.
The API key must be created using the {apm-guide-ref}/api-key.html[APM server command-line tool].

WARNING: API keys only provide any real security if your APM Server uses TLS.

[float]
[[config-service-version]]
==== `service_version`
[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                    | Django/Flask        | Default    | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_VERSION`  | `SERVICE_VERSION`   | `None`     | A string indicating the version of the deployed service
|============

A version string for the currently deployed version of the service.
If youre deploys are not versioned, the recommended value for this field is the commit identifier of the deployed revision, e.g. the output of `git rev-parse HEAD`.

[float]
[[config-framework-name]]
==== `framework_name`
[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                  | Django/Flask     | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_FRAMEWORK_NAME` | `FRAMEWORK_NAME` | Depending on framework
|============

The name of the used framework.
For Django and Flask, this defaults to `django` and `flask` respectively,
otherwise, the default is `None`.


[float]
[[config-framework-version]]
==== `framework_version`
[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                     | Django/Flask        | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_FRAMEWORK_VERSION` | `FRAMEWORK_VERSION` | Depending on framework
|============

The version number of the used framework.
For Django and Flask, this defaults to the used version of the framework,
otherwise, the default is `None`.

[float]
[[config-filter-exception-types]]
==== `filter_exception_types`
[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                          | Django/Flask                  | Default  | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_FILTER_EXCEPTION_TYPES` | `FILTER_EXCEPTION_TYPES`      | `[]`     | `['OperationalError', 'mymodule.SomeoneElsesProblemError']`
| multiple values separated by commas, without spaces |||
|============

A list of exception types to be filtered.
Exceptions of these types will not be sent to the APM Server.


[float]
[[config-transaction-ignore-urls]]
==== `transaction_ignore_urls`
[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                           | Django/Flask              | Default  | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_IGNORE_URLS` | `TRANSACTION_IGNORE_URLS` | `[]`     | `['/api/ping', '/static/*']`
| multiple values separated by commas, without spaces |||
|============

A list of URLs for which the agent should not capture any transaction data.

Optionally, `*` can be used to match multiple URLs at once.

[float]
[[config-transactions-ignore-patterns]]
==== `transactions_ignore_patterns`
[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                                | Django/Flask                    | Default  | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTIONS_IGNORE_PATTERNS` | `TRANSACTIONS_IGNORE_PATTERNS`  | `[]`     | `['^OPTIONS ', 'myviews.Healthcheck']`
| multiple values separated by commas, without spaces |||
|============

A list of regular expressions.
Transactions with a name that matches any of the configured patterns will be ignored and not sent to the APM Server.

NOTE: as the the name of the transaction can only be determined at the end of the transaction,
the agent might still cause overhead for transactions ignored through this setting.
If agent overhead is a concern, we recommend <<config-transaction-ignore-urls,`transaction_ignore_urls`>> instead.

[float]
[[config-server-timeout]]
==== `server_timeout`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                  | Django/Flask         | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_TIMEOUT` | `SERVER_TIMEOUT`     | `"5s"`
|============

A timeout for requests to the APM Server.
The setting has to be provided in *<<config-format-duration, duration format>>*.
If a request to the APM Server takes longer than the configured timeout,
the request is cancelled and the event (exception or transaction) is discarded.
Set to `None` to disable timeouts.

WARNING: If timeouts are disabled or set to a high value,
your app could experience memory issues if the APM Server times out.


[float]
[[config-hostname]]
==== `hostname`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                | Django/Flask  | Default                | Example
| `ELASTIC_APM_HOSTNAME`     | `HOSTNAME`    | `socket.gethostname()` | `app-server01.example.com`
|============

The host name to use when sending error and transaction data to the APM Server.

[float]
[[config-auto-log-stacks]]
==== `auto_log_stacks`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                   | Django/Flask      | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_AUTO_LOG_STACKS` | `AUTO_LOG_STACKS` | `True`
| set to `"true"` / `"false"` |||
|============

If set to `True` (the default), the agent will add a stack trace to each log event,
indicating where the log message has been issued.

This setting can be overridden on an individual basis by setting the `extra`-key `stack`:

[source,python]
----
logger.info('something happened', extra={'stack': False})
----

[float]
[[config-collect-local-variables]]
==== `collect_local_variables`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                           | Django/Flask              | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_COLLECT_LOCAL_VARIABLES` | `COLLECT_LOCAL_VARIABLES` | `errors`
|============

Possible values: `errors`, `transactions`, `all`, `off`

The Elastic APM Python agent can collect local variables for stack frames.
By default, this is only done for errors.

NOTE: Collecting local variables has a non-trivial overhead.
Collecting local variables for transactions in production environments
can have adverse effects for the performance of your service.

[float]
[[config-local-var-max-length]]
==== `local_var_max_length`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                        | Django/Flask           | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_LOCAL_VAR_MAX_LENGTH` | `LOCAL_VAR_MAX_LENGTH` | `200`
|============

When collecting local variables, they will be converted to strings.
This setting allows you to limit the length of the resulting string.


[float]
[[config-local-list-var-max-length]]
==== `local_var_list_max_length`

|============
| Environment                             | Django/Flask                | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_LOCAL_VAR_LIST_MAX_LENGTH` | `LOCAL_VAR_LIST_MAX_LENGTH` | `10`
|============

This setting allows you to limit the length of lists in local variables.


[float]
[[config-local-dict-var-max-length]]
==== `local_var_dict_max_length`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                             | Django/Flask                | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_LOCAL_VAR_DICT_MAX_LENGTH` | `LOCAL_VAR_DICT_MAX_LENGTH` | `10`
|============

This setting allows you to limit the length of dicts in local variables.


[float]
[[config-source-lines-error-app-frames]]
==== `source_lines_error_app_frames`
[float]
[[config-source-lines-error-library-frames]]

[[config-source-lines-span-app-frames]]
==== `source_lines_span_app_frames`
[float]
[[config-source-lines-span-library-frames]]
==== `source_lines_span_library_frames`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                                     | Django/Flask                        | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_SOURCE_LINES_ERROR_APP_FRAMES`     | `SOURCE_LINES_ERROR_APP_FRAMES`     | `5`
| `ELASTIC_APM_SOURCE_LINES_ERROR_LIBRARY_FRAMES` | `SOURCE_LINES_ERROR_LIBRARY_FRAMES` | `5`
| `ELASTIC_APM_SOURCE_LINES_SPAN_APP_FRAMES`      | `SOURCE_LINES_SPAN_APP_FRAMES`      | `0`
| `ELASTIC_APM_SOURCE_LINES_SPAN_LIBRARY_FRAMES`  | `SOURCE_LINES_SPAN_LIBRARY_FRAMES`  | `0`
|============

By default, the APM agent collects source code snippets for errors.
This setting allows you to modify the number of lines of source code that are being collected.

We differ between errors and spans, as well as library frames and app frames.

WARNING: Especially for spans, collecting source code can have a large impact on storage use in your Elasticsearch cluster.

[float]
[[config-capture-body]]
==== `capture_body`

<<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >>

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                | Django/Flask   | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_CAPTURE_BODY` | `CAPTURE_BODY` | `off`
|============

For transactions that are HTTP requests,
the Python agent can optionally capture the request body (e.g. `POST` variables).

Possible values: `errors`, `transactions`, `all`, `off`.

If the request has a body and this setting is disabled, the body will be shown as `[REDACTED]`.

For requests with a content type of `multipart/form-data`,
any uploaded files will be referenced in a special `_files` key.
It contains the name of the field and the name of the uploaded file, if provided.

WARNING: Request bodies often contain sensitive values like passwords and credit card numbers.
If your service handles data like this, we advise to only enable this feature with care.

[float]
[[config-capture-headers]]
==== `capture_headers`

<<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >>

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                   | Django/Flask      | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_CAPTURE_HEADERS` | `CAPTURE_HEADERS` | `true`
|============

For transactions and errors that happen due to HTTP requests,
the Python agent can optionally capture the request and response headers.

Possible values: `true`, `false`

WARNING: Request headers often contain sensitive values like session IDs and cookies.
See <<sanitizing-data,sanitizing data>> for more information on how to filter out sensitive data.

[float]
[[config-transaction-max-spans]]
==== `transaction_max_spans`

<<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >>

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                         | Django/Flask            | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_MAX_SPANS` | `TRANSACTION_MAX_SPANS` | `500`
|============

This limits the amount of spans that are recorded per transaction.
This is helpful in cases where a transaction creates a very high amount of spans (e.g. thousands of SQL queries).
Setting an upper limit will prevent edge cases from overloading the agent and the APM Server.

[float]
[[config-stack-trace-limit]]
==== `stack_trace_limit`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                     | Django/Flask        | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_STACK_TRACE_LIMIT` | `STACK_TRACE_LIMIT` | `500`
|============

This limits the number of frames captured for each stack trace.

Setting the limit to `0` will disable stack trace collection,
while any positive integer value will be used as the maximum number of frames to collect.
To disable the limit and always capture all frames, set the value to `-1`.


[float]
[[config-span-frames-min-duration]]
==== `span_frames_min_duration`

<<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >>

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                            | Django/Flask               | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_SPAN_FRAMES_MIN_DURATION` | `SPAN_FRAMES_MIN_DURATION` | `"5ms"`
|============

In its default settings, the APM agent will collect a stack trace with every recorded span.
While this is very helpful to find the exact place in your code that causes the span,
collecting this stack trace does have some overhead.

To collect traces for all spans, independent of the length, set the value to `-1`.
Setting it to a positive value, e.g. `5ms`, will limit stack trace collection to spans
with durations equal or longer than the given value.

To disable stack trace collection for spans completely, set the value to `0`.

Except for the special values `-1` and `0`,
this setting has to be provided in *<<config-format-duration, duration format>>*.

[float]
[[config-span-compression-enabled]]
==== `span_compression_enabled`

<<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >>

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                            | Django/Flask               | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_SPAN_COMPRESSION_ENABLED` | `SPAN_COMPRESSION_ENABLED` | `False`
|============

Enable/disable span compression.

If enabled, the agent will compress very short, repeated spans into a single span,
which is beneficial for storage and processing requirements.
Some information is lost in this process, e.g. exact durations of each compressed span.

[float]
[[config-span-compression-exact-match-max_duration]]
==== `span_compression_exact_match_max_duration`

<<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >>

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                            | Django/Flask               | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_SPAN_COMPRESSION_EXACT_MATCH_MAX_DURATION` | `SPAN_COMPRESSION_EXACT_MATCH_MAX_DURATION` | `"50ms"`
|============

Consecutive spans that are exact match and that are under this threshold will be compressed into a single composite span.
This reduces the collection, processing, and storage overhead, and removes clutter from the UI.
The tradeoff is that the DB statements of all the compressed spans will not be collected.

Two spans are considered exact matches if the following attributes are identical:
 * span name
 * span type
 * span subtype
 * destination resource (e.g. the Database name)

[float]
[[config-span-compression-same-kind-max-duration]]
==== `span_compression_same_kind_max_duration`

<<dynamic-configuration, image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] >>

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                            | Django/Flask               | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_SPAN_COMPRESSION_SAME_KIND_MAX_DURATION` | `SPAN_COMPRESSION_SAME_KIND_MAX_DURATION` | `"5ms"`
|============

Consecutive spans to the same destination that are under this threshold will be compressed into a single composite span.
This reduces the collection, processing, and storage overhead, and removes clutter from the UI.
The tradeoff is that metadata such as database statements of all the compressed spans will not be collected.

Two spans are considered to be of the same kind if the following attributes are identical:
 * span type
 * span subtype
 * destination resource (e.g. the Database name)

| Environment                            | Django/Flask               | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_EXIT_SPAN_MIN_DURATION` | `EXIT_SPAN_MIN_DURATION` | `"1ms"`
|============

Exit spans are spans that represent a call to an external service, like a database.
If such calls are very short, they are usually not relevant and can be ignored.

NOTE: if a span propagates distributed tracing IDs, it will not be ignored, even if it is shorter than the configured threshold.
This is to ensure that no broken traces are recorded.

| `ELASTIC_APM_API_REQUEST_SIZE` | `API_REQUEST_SIZE` | `"768kb"`
|============

The maximum queue length of the request buffer before sending the request to the APM Server.
A lower value will increase the load on your APM Server,
while a higher value can increase the memory pressure of your app.
A higher value also impacts the time until data is indexed and searchable in Elasticsearch.

This setting is useful to limit memory consumption if you experience a sudden spike of traffic.
It has to be provided in *<<config-format-size, size format>>*.

NOTE: Due to internal buffering of gzip, the actual request size can be a few kilobytes larger than the given limit.
By default, the APM Server limits request payload size to `1 MByte`.

| `ELASTIC_APM_API_REQUEST_TIME` | `API_REQUEST_TIME` | `"10s"`
|============

The maximum queue time of the request buffer before sending the request to the APM Server.
A lower value will increase the load on your APM Server,
while a higher value can increase the memory pressure of your app.
A higher value also impacts the time until data is indexed and searchable in Elasticsearch.

This setting is useful to limit memory consumption if you experience a sudden spike of traffic.
It has to be provided in *<<config-format-duration, duration format>>*.

NOTE: The actual time will vary between 90-110% of the given value,
to avoid stampedes of instances that start at the same time.

| `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_SAMPLE_RATE` | `TRANSACTION_SAMPLE_RATE` | `1.0`
|============

By default, the agent samples every transaction (e.g. request to your service).
To reduce overhead and storage requirements, set the sample rate to a value between `0.0` and `1.0`.
We still record overall time and the result for unsampled transactions, but no context information, labels, or spans.

NOTE: This setting will be automatically rounded to 4 decimals of precision.

[float]
[[config-include-paths]]

| multiple values separated by commas, without spaces |||
|============

A set of paths, optionally using shell globs
(see https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html[`fnmatch`] for a description of the syntax).
These are matched against the absolute filename of every frame, and if a pattern matches, the frame is considered
to be an "in-app frame".

`include_paths` *takes precedence* over `exclude_paths`.

[float]
[[config-exclude-paths]]

| multiple values separated by commas, without spaces |||
|============

A set of paths, optionally using shell globs
(see https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html[`fnmatch`] for a description of the syntax).
These are matched against the absolute filename of every frame, and if a pattern matches, the frame is considered
to be a "library frame".

`include_paths` *takes precedence* over `exclude_paths`.

The default value varies based on your Python version and implementation, e.g.:

 * PyPy3: `['\*/lib-python/3/*', '\*/site-packages/*']`
 * CPython 2.7: `['\*/lib/python2.7/*', '\*/lib64/python2.7/*']`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment               | Django/Flask | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_INSTRUMENT`  | `INSTRUMENT` | `True`
|============

If set to `False`, the agent won't instrument any code.
This disables most of the tracing functionality, but can be useful to debug possible instrumentation issues.


[float]
[[config-verify-server-cert]]
==== `verify_server_cert`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                       | Django/Flask         | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT`  | `VERIFY_SERVER_CERT` | `True`
|============

By default, the agent verifies the SSL certificate if an HTTPS connection to the APM Server is used.
Verification can be disabled by changing this setting to `False`.
This setting is ignored when <<config-server-cert,`server_cert`>> is set.

NOTE: SSL certificate verification is only available in Python 2.7.9+ and Python 3.4.3+.

[[config-use-elastic-traceparent-header]]
==== `use_elastic_traceparent_header`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                                  | Django/Flask                     | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_USE_ELASTIC_TRACEPARENT_HEADER` | `USE_ELASTIC_TRACEPARENT_HEADER` | `True`
|============

To enable {apm-guide-ref}/distributed-tracing.html[distributed tracing],
the agent sets a number of HTTP headers to outgoing requests made with <<automatic-instrumentation-http,instrumented HTTP libraries>>.
These headers (`traceparent` and `tracestate`) are defined in the https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-1/[W3C Trace Context] specification.

Additionally, when this setting is set to `True`, the agent will set `elasticapm-traceparent` for backwards compatibility.

[float]
[[config-use-elastic-excepthook]]
==== `use_elastic_excepthook`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                          | Django/Flask             | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_USE_ELASTIC_EXCEPTHOOK` | `USE_ELASTIC_EXCEPTHOOK` | `False`

| `ELASTIC_APM_DJANGO_TRANSACTION_NAME_FROM_ROUTE`  | `DJANGO_TRANSACTION_NAME_FROM_ROUTE` | `False`
|============


By default, we use the function or class name of the view as the transaction name.
Starting with Django 2.2, Django makes the route (e.g. `users/<int:user_id>/`) available on the `request.resolver_match` object.
If you want to use the route instead of the view name as the transaction name, set this config option to `true`.

NOTE: in versions previous to Django 2.2, changing this setting will have no effect.

[float]
[[config-django-autoinsert-middleware]]
==== `django_autoinsert_middleware`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment                                 | Django                         | Default
| `ELASTIC_APM_DJANGO_AUTOINSERT_MIDDLEWARE`  | `DJANGO_AUTOINSERT_MIDDLEWARE` | `True`
|============

To trace Django requests, the agent uses a middleware, `elasticapm.contrib.django.middleware.TracingMiddleware`.
By default, this middleware is inserted automatically as the first item in `settings.MIDDLEWARES`.
To disable the automatic insertion of the middleware, change this setting to `False`.


[float]
[[config-generic-environment]]
=== Generic Environment variables

Some environment variables that are not specific to the APM agent can be used to configure the agent.

[float]
[[config-generic-http-proxy]]
==== `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`

By using `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`, the agent can be instructed to use a proxy to connect to the APM Server.
If both are set, `HTTPS_PROXY` takes precedence.

NOTE: The environment variables are case-insensitive.

[float]
[[config-generic-no-proxy]]
==== `NO_PROXY`

To instruct the agent to *not* use a proxy, you can use the `NO_PROXY` environment variable.
You can either set it to a comma-separated list of hosts for which no proxy should be used (e.g. `localhost,example.com`)
or use `*` to match any host.

This is useful if `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` is set for other reasons than agent / APM Server communication.


[float]
[[config-ssl-cert-file]]
==== `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR`

To tell the agent to use a different SSL certificate, you can use these environment variables.
See also https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/openssl-env.html#SSL_CERT_DIR-SSL_CERT_FILE[OpenSSL docs].

Please note that these variables may apply to other SSL/TLS communication in your service,
not just related to the APM agent.

NOTE: These environment variables only take effect if <<config-use-certifi,`use_certifi`>> is set to `False`.

[float]
[[config-formats]]
=== Configuration formats

Some options require a unit, either duration or size.
These need to be provided in a specific format.

[float]
[[config-format-duration]]
==== Duration format

The _duration_ format is used for options like timeouts.
The unit is provided as a suffix directly after the number–without any separation by whitespace.

*Example*: `5ms`

*Supported units*

 * `us` (microseconds)
 * `ms` (milliseconds)
 * `s` (seconds)
 * `m` (minutes)

[float]
[[config-format-size]]
==== Size format

The _size_ format is used for options like maximum buffer sizes.
The unit is provided as suffix directly after the number, without and separation by whitespace.


*Example*: `10kb`

*Supported units*:

 * `b` (bytes)
 * `kb` (kilobytes)
 * `mb` (megabytes)
 * `gb` (gigabytes)

NOTE: We use the power-of-two sizing convention, e.g. `1 kilobyte == 1024 bytes`
