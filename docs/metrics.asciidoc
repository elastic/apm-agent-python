With Elastic APM, you can capture system and process metrics.
These metrics will be sent regularly to the APM Server and from there to Elasticsearch

==== CPU/Memory Metric Set

`elasticapm.metrics.sets.cpu.CPUMetricSet`

This metric set collects various system metrics and metrics of the current process.

|============
| Metric                              | Type         | Format  | Description
| `system.cpu.total.norm.pct`         | scaled_float | percent | The percentage of CPU time in states other than Idle and IOWait, normalised by the number of cores.
| `system.memory.total`               | long         | bytes   | The total memory of the system in bytes
| `system.memory.actual.free`         | long         | bytes   | Actual free memory in bytes
| `system.process.cpu.total.norm.pct` | scaled_float | percent | The percentage of CPU time spent by the process since the last event. This value is normalized by the number of CPU cores and it ranges from 0 to 100%.
| `system.process.memory.size`        | long         | bytes   | The total virtual memory the process has.
| `system.process.memory.rss.bytes`   | long         | bytes   | The Resident Set Size. The amount of memory the process occupied in main memory (RAM).
