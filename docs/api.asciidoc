[[api]]
== Public API

The Elastic APM Python agent has several public APIs.
Most of the public API functionality is not needed when using one of our <<framework-support, supported frameworks>>,
but they allow customized usage.

[float]
[[client-api]]
=== Client API

The public Client API consists of several methods on the `Client` class.
This API can be used to track exceptions and log messages,
as well as to mark the beginning and end of transactions.

[float]
[[client-api-init]]
==== Instantiation

To create a `Client` instance, import it and call its constructor:

[source,python]
----
from elasticapm import Client

client = Client({'SERVICE_NAME': 'example'}, **defaults)
----

 * `config`: A dictionary, with key/value configuration. For the possible configuration keys, see <<configuration, Configuration>>.
 * `**defaults`: default values for configuration. These can be omitted in most cases, and take the least precedence.
 
NOTE: framework integrations like <<django-support, Django>> and <<flask-support, Flask>>
instantiate the client automatically. 

[float]
[[error-api]]
==== Errors

[float]
[[client-api-capture-exception]]
===== `Client.capture_exception()`

Captures an exception object:

[source,python]
----
try:
    x = int("five")
except ValueError:
    client.capture_exception()
----

 * `exc_info`: A `(type, value, traceback)` tuple as returned by https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exc_info[`sys.exc_info()`]. If not provided, it will be captured automatically.
 * `date`: A `datetime.datetime` object representing the occurrence time of the error. If left empty, it defaults to `datetime.datetime.utcnow()`.
 * `context`: A dictionary with contextual information. This dictionary must follow the 
    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/server/current/error-api.html#error-context-schema[Context] schema definition.
 * `custom`: A dictionary of custom data you want to attach to the event.
 * `handled`: A boolean to indicate if this exception was handled or not.

Returns the id of the error as a string.

[float]
[[client-api-capture-message]]
===== `Client.capture_message()`

Captures a message with optional added contextual data. Example:

[source,python]
----
client.capture_message('Billing process succeeded.')
----

 * `message`: The message as a string.
 * `param_message`: Alternatively, a parametrized message as a dictionary.
    The dictionary contains two values: `message`, and `params`.
    This allows the APM server to group messages together that share the same
    parametrized message. Example:
+
[source,python]
----
client.capture_message(param_message={
    'message': 'Billing process for %s succeeded. Amount: %s',
    'params': (customer.id, order.total_amount),
})
----
+
 * `stack`: If set to `True` (the default), a stacktrace from the call site will be captured.
 * `exc_info`: A `(type, value, traceback)` tuple as returned by
   https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exc_info[`sys.exc_info()`].
   If not provided, it will be captured automatically, if `capture_message()` was called in an `except` block.
 * `date`: A `datetime.datetime` object representing the occurrence time of the error.
   If left empty, it defaults to `datetime.datetime.utcnow()`.
 * `context`: A dictionary with contextual information. This dictionary must follow the 
    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/server/current/error-api.html#error-context-schema[Context] schema definition.
 * `custom`: A dictionary of custom data you want to attach to the event.

Returns the id of the message as a string.

NOTE: Either the `message` or the `param_message` argument is required.

[float]
[[transaction-api]]
==== Transactions

[float]
[[client-api-begin-transaction]]
===== `Client.begin_transaction()`
Begin tracking a transaction.
Should be called e.g. at the beginning of a request or when starting a background task. Example:

[source,python]
----
client.begin_transaction('processors')
----

 * `transaction_type`: (*required*) A string describing the type of the transaction, e.g. `'request'` or `'celery'`.

[float]
[[client-api-end-transaction]]
===== `Client.end_transaction()`
End tracking the transaction.
Should be called e.g. at the end of a request or when ending a background task. Example:

[source,python]
----
client.end_transaction('myapp.billing_process', processor.status)
----

 * `name`: (*optional*) A string describing the name of the transaction, e.g. `process_order`.
   This is typically the name of the view/controller that handles the request, or the route name.
 * `result`: (*optional*) A string describing the result of the transaction.
   This is typically the HTTP status code, or e.g. `'success'` for a background task.

NOTE: if `name` and `result` are not set in the `end_transaction()` call,
they have to be set beforehand by calling <<api-set-transaction-name, `elasticapm.set_transaction_name()`>> and <<api-set-transaction-result, `elasticapm.set_transaction_result()`>> during the transaction.

[float]
[[api-other]]
=== Other APIs

[float]
[[api-elasticapm-instrument]]
==== `elasticapm.instrument()`

Instruments libraries automatically.
This includes a wide range of standard library and 3rd party modules.
A list of instrumented modules can be found in `elasticapm.intrumentation.register`.
This function should be called as early as possibly in the startup of your application.
For <<framework-support, supported frameworks>>, this is called automatically. Example:

[source,python]
----
import elasticapm

elasticapm.instrument()
----

[float]
[[api-set-transaction-name]]
==== `elasticapm.set_transaction_name()`

Set the name of the current transaction.
For supported frameworks, the transaction name is determined automatically,
and can be overridden using this function. Example:

[source,python]
----
import elasticapm

elasticapm.set_transaction_name('myapp.billing_process')
----

 * `name`: (*required*) A string describing name of the transaction
 * `override`: if `True` (the default), overrides any previously set transaction name.
    If `False`, only sets the name if the transaction name hasn't already been set.


[float]
[[api-set-transaction-result]]
==== `elasticapm.set_transaction_result()`

Set the name of the current transaction.
For supported frameworks, the transaction result is determined automatically,
and can be overridden using this function. Example:

[source,python]
----
import elasticapm

elasticapm.set_transaction_result('SUCCESS')
----

 * `result`: (*required*) A string describing the result of the transaction, e.g. `HTTP 2xx` or `SUCCESS`
 * `override`: if `True` (the default), overrides any previously set result.
    If `False`, only sets the result if the result hasn't already been set.

[float]
[[api-set-custom-context]]
==== `elasticapm.set_custom_context()`

Attach custom contextual data to the current transaction and errors.
Supported frameworks will automatically attach information about the HTTP request and the logged in user.
You can attach further data using this function. Example:

[source,python]
----
import elasticapm

elasticapm.set_custom_context({'billing_amount': product.price * item_count})
----

 * `data`: (*required*) A dictionary with the data to be attached. This should be a flat key/value `dict` object.

Errors that happen after this call will also have the custom context attached to them.
You can call this function multiple times, new context data will be merged with existing data,
following the `update()` semantics of Python dictionaries.

[float]
[[api-set-user-context]]
==== `elasticapm.set_user_context()`

Attach information about the currently logged in user to the current transaction and errors.
Example:

[source,python]
----
import elasticapm

elasticapm.set_user_context(username=user.username, email=user.email, id=user.id)
----

 * `username`: The username of the logged in user
 * `email`: The email of the logged in user
 * `id`: The unique identifier of the logged in user, e.g. the primary key value

Errors that happen after this call will also have the user context attached to them.
You can call this function multiple times, new user data will be merged with existing data,
following the `update()` semantics of Python dictionaries.


[float]
[[api-tag]]
==== `elasticapm.tag()`

Attach tags to the the current transaction and errors.
Example:

[source,python]
----
import elasticapm

elasticapm.tag(ecommerce=True, dollar_value=47.12)
----

Errors that happen after this call will also have the tags attached to them.
You can call this function multiple times, new tags will be merged with existing tags,
following the `update()` semantics of Python dictionaries.
