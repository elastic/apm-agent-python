[[release-notes-4.0.0]]
==== v4.0.0

https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/compare/v3.0.2\...v4.0.0[Check the diff]

**BREAKING** Version 4 of the agent implements a new wire protocol for communicating with
the APM Server. This format is only supported in *APM Server 6.5+*.

Further breaking changes:

* The undocumented `AsyncioHTTPTransport` has been removed.
* The `flush_interval` and `max_queue_size` settings have been removed.
* new settings introduced: `api_request_time` and `api_request_size`.
* Some settings now require a unit for duration or size. See documentation on
configuration for more information.
* The option to provide a custom date for exceptions and messages has been removed.

Other changes:
* on Python 3.7, use https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html[contextvars] instead of threadlocals for storing
current transaction and span. This is a necessary precursor for full asyncio support. {pull}291[#291]
