===== Deprecations

This will be the last minor release to support the following versions:

 * Python 3.4
 * Django 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10
 * Flask < 1.0

 In addition, as of this release we only supported capturing extended
 information on elasticsearch queries when using keyword arguments with the
 elasticsearch-py API. This is in keeping with the
 https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/api.html#api-documentation[upstream policy]
 of positional arguments being unsupported. {pull}697[#697]

[[release-notes-4.0.0]]
==== v4.0.0

https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/compare/v3.0.2\...v4.0.0[Check the diff]

**BREAKING** Version 4 of the agent implements a new wire protocol for communicating with
the APM Server. This format is only supported in *APM Server 6.5+*.

Further breaking changes:

* The undocumented `AsyncioHTTPTransport` has been removed.
* The `flush_interval` and `max_queue_size` settings have been removed.
* new settings introduced: `api_request_time` and `api_request_size`.
* Some settings now require a unit for duration or size. See documentation on
configuration for more information.
* The option to provide a custom date for exceptions and messages has been removed.

Other changes:
* on Python 3.7, use https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html[contextvars] instead of threadlocals for storing
current transaction and span. This is a necessary precursor for full asyncio support. {pull}291[#291]
