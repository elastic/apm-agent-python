=== Unreleased
https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/compare/v1.0.0\...master[Check the HEAD diff]

 * moved the library-frame detection from a processor to the stacktrace collection ({pull}113[#113]).
 * added settings to enable/disable source code collection and local variables collection
   for errors and transactions ({pull}117[#117])
 * added `service.environment` to provide an environment name (e.g. "production", "staging") ({pull}123[#123])
 * added `transaction.id` to errors to better correlate errors with transactions ({pull}122[#122])
 * added `transaction_sample_rate` to define a rate with which transactions are sampled ({pull}116[#116])
 * added `error.handled` to indicate if an exception was handled or not ({pull}124[#124]).
 * added `transaction_max_spans` setting to limit the amount of spans that are recorded per transaction ({pull}127[#127])
 * added configuration options to limit captured local variables to a certain length ({pull}130[#130])
 * added options for configuring the amount of context lines that are captured with each frame ({pull}136[#136])
 * added support for tracing queries formatted as http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/sql.html[`psycopg2.sql.SQL`] objects ({pull}148[#148])
 * switched to `time.perf_counter` as timing function on Python 3 ({pull}138[#138])
 * added option to disable capturing of request body ({pull}151[#151])
 * BREAKING: Several settings and APIs have been renamed ({pull}111[#111], {pull}119[#119], {pull}143[#143]):
 ** The decorator for custom instrumentation, `elasticapm.trace`, is now `elasticapm.capture_span`
 ** The setting `traces_send_frequency` has been renamed to `flush_interval`.
     The name of the analogous environment variable changed from `ELASTIC_APM_TRACES_SEND_FREQ`
     to `ELASTIC_APM_FLUSH_INTERVAL`
 ** The `app_name` setting has been renamed to `service_name`.
     The name of the analogous environment variable changed from `ELASTIC_APM_APP_NAME`
     to `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME`.
 ** `app_name` arguments to API calls in the whole code base changed to `service_name`.
 ** The `app_version` setting has been renamed to `service_version`.
     The name of the analogous environment variable changed from `ELASTIC_APM_APP_VERSION`
     to `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_VERSION`.
 ** `context.request.url.raw` has been renamed to `context.request.url.full` ({pull}121[#121])
 * BREAKING: added `elasticapm.set_custom_context` in favor of the more generic `set_custom_data` function ({pull}133[#133])
 * BREAKING: `include_patterns` and `exclude_patterns` now use shell globs instead of regular expressions, and
             are matched against the full path file path of the module, not against the module name ({pull}137[#137])
 * BREAKING: renamed several configuration options to align better with other language agents ({pull}145[#145]):
 ** `disable_instrumentation` became `instrument` and inverted its meaning
 ** `max_event_queue_length` became `max_queue_size`
 ** `timeout` became `server_timeout`

 * added `max-event-queue-length` setting. ({pull}67[#67])
 * changed name that the agent reports itself with to the APM server from `elasticapm-python` to `python`. This aligns the Python agent with other languages. ({pull}104[#104])
 * changed Celery integration to store the task state (e.g. `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`) in `transaction.result` ({pull}100[#100])
 * added setting to disable SSL certificate verification ({pull}108[#108])
 * BREAKING: renamed `server` configuration variable to `server_url` to better align with other language agents ({pull}105[#105]) 
 * BREAKING: removed the old and unused urllib2-based HTTP transport, and renamed the urllib3 transport ({pull}107[#107])
 * BREAKING: several API changes to `capture_exception`, `capture_message`, and added documentation for these and other APIs ({pull}112[#112])

=== v1.0.0.dev3

https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python/compare/v1.0.0.dev2\...v1.0.0.dev2[Check the diff]


 * added a background thread to process the transactions queue every 60 seconds (configurable) ({pull}68[#68])
 * adapted trace context for SQL traces to new API ({pull}77[#77])
 * ensured that transaction data is also passed through processors ({pull}84[#84])
 * added `uninstrument` function to reverse instrumentation,
   and exposed both `instrument` and `uninstrument` as public API in the `elasticapm` namespace  ({pull}90[#90])
 * added normalization of HTTP status codes into classes for the `transaction.result` field. A HTTP status of `200`
   will be turned into `HTTP 2xx`. The unchanged status code is still available in `context.response.status_code`.
   ({pull}85[#85])

=== v1.0.0.dev2

 * added request context information for Flask ({pull}58[#58])
 * added response context information for Flask ({pull}65[#65])
 * BREAKING: changed the `SERVERS` list setting to a single `SERVER` string setting.
   With this change, we now only support sending events to a single server ({pull}59[#59])
 * BREAKING: removed root trace. Due to historical reason, we used to create a "root trace" which was equivalent
   to the transaction. This is no longer necessary. {pull}61[#61]
